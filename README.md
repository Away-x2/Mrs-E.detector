# Emotion Detection using CNN Transfer Learning

## Description
This project focuses on detecting human emotions using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and transfer learning with the VGG16 and MobileNet models. The objective is to classify facial expressions into different emotion categories, enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of emotion recognition systems.

## Data Source
The data used in this project is from the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013

## Data Description
The dataset contains images of faces labeled with various emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, and more. Each image is pre-processed and normalized to be fed into the VGG16 and MobileNet models for training and inference.

## Usage Instructions
To use the data and run the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/emotion-detection.git](https://github.com/Away-x2/Mrs-E.detector.git
   cd Mrs-E.detector
